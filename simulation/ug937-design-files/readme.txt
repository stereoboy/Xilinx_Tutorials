1. REVISION HISTORY 

                 Readme  
Date             Version      Revision Description
========================================================================
06April2016     1.4          Updated for the 2016.1 release	
========================================================================


2. NOTES
These are the Vivado Design Suite Tutorial: Logic Simulation design files.

a. Sine Wave Generator : Generates high, medium and low frequency and amplitude sine waves. 
   File: sinegen.vhd

b. FSM : A Finite State Machine to select one of the four sine waves 
    File: fsm.vhd

c. Debouncer : Enables switch select between raw and debounced version of Sine wave selector. 
   File: debounce.vhd

d. Design Top: Resets FSM and SineGen, MUXes the sine select results to the LED output 
   File: sinegen_demo.vhd

e. Testbench : A simple testbench to simulate the Sine Wave Generator design 
   File: testbench.v
   Main functionality:
   	Generates a 200 MHz input clock for the design system clock 	(sys_clk_p)
   	Generates GPIO button selections
   	Controls raw & debounced sine wave select
